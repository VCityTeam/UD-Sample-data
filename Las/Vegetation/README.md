# Vegetation

This example is linked to [this project](https://github.com/VCityTeam/UD-VCity-Vegetation-LasToMesh/).  
The files are portions of the LIDAR representing the city of Lyon and its surroundings. The full datas can be found [here](https://data.grandlyon.com/jeux-de-donnees/nuage-points-lidar-2018-metropole-lyon-format-laz/info).  
  
The two files represent different types of vegetation. One represents a densely packed set of trees. The other represents two trees clearly separated. It can be used to show the difference in process between these two cases.
