## About polygons_loa_lyon

This file contains polygons in EPSG:3946 projection. Those polygons were computed with [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) using the 'Vector geometry/Polygonize' operation on a roads layer.

The roads layer is from open data and can be found online: 'TRONCON_DE_ROUTE' of [BD TOPO DÉPARTEMENT SHAPEFILE - RHÔNE](https://geoservices.ign.fr/telechargement) of IGN.

This file can be used by [Py3DTilers](https://github.com/VCityTeam/py3dtilers) to create [LoA](https://github.com/VCityTeam/py3dtilers/tree/master/py3dtilers/Common#loa) (Level of Abstraction) tiles.
